### Hi, I am Felipe! 

## Who am I?

I'm 23 years old, an **IT Technician** when i was in high school, now coursing a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science**.

I am not currently working, but i'm looking for a first opportunity and, in the meantime, i'm improving my skills to keep them sharp. You can see some of **my projects here pinned in my home page**.

_PS: My stats are showing that my most used language is jupyter notebook, but this is only because i've done a college work and i needed to uploaded it here. Soon i will remove it._ ðŸ˜…

## My objective

I am currently a full stack developer, with knowledge on **backend** and **frontend**. I love to work like this because i can see the poject as whole and is easier to fix bugs and see improvements.

If i was to choose only one of them, i would choose frontend 'cause it's the stack that i'm mostly coding today.

I also want to learn some mobile development with **React Native**. I've already seen **Flutter**, but i think i'll fell more comfortable with RN, so is that I use React.
